--The Task--

You need to develop and deploy a an app that writes a new file to S3 on every execution.

You are free to choose any of the following programming languages: Python, Java, NodeJS
or Golang.

These files need to be maintained only for 24h.

The content of the file is not important, but add the date and time as prefix for your file name.

The name of the buckets should be the following ones for QA and Staging respectively: qa-
FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME-stormreply-platform-challenge and staging-FIRSTNAMELASTNAME-
stormreply-platform-challenge.

The app will be running as a docker container in a Kubernetes cluster every 5 minutes.

There is a Namespace for QA and a different Namespace for Staging in the cluster. You
don’t need to provide tests but you need to be sure the app will work.

--Deployment--

You can use your own personal AWS account (S3 service is covered in the free tier). In case
you don’t have an AWS account, you can use localstack as a mock for having a S3 bucket
locally and running your app.

Along with the function code you need to provide Terraform resources to provision the S3
bucket (and its associated resources),
